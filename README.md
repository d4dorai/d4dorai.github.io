## Projects

###  Midday Meals in India

The final result of this project is a published paper. An older version of the paper is available online [here](http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=1969396). This version has been revised and extended and will be soon forthcoming in the Scandinavian Journal of Economics. It is also Chapter 1 of my PhD Thesis.


**Abstract:**

_At the end of 2001, the Indian Supreme Court issued a directive ordering states to institute school lunches -- known locally as ``midday meals" -- in government primary schools. This paper provides a large-scale assessment of the enrollment effects of India's midday meal scheme, which offers warm lunches, free of cost, to 120 million primary school children across India and is the largest school feeding program in the world. To isolate the causal effect of the policy, we make use of its staggered implementation across Indian states in government but not private schools. Using a panel data set of over 420,000 schools observed annually from 2002 to 2004, we find that midday meals result in substantial increases in primary school enrollment, driven by early primary school responses to the program. Our results are robust to a wide range of specification tests._


**In the News:** The findings of this paper are mentioned in [The Guardian](http://www.theguardian.com/global-development/poverty-matters/2013/jul/19/indian-school-lunch-deaths-midday-meals) as well as in [The Times of India](http://epaper.timesofindia.com/Default/Scripting/ArticleWin.asp?From=Archive&Source=Page&Skin=TOINEW&BaseHref=CAP%2F2010%2F07%2F26&ViewMode=HTML&PageLabel=38&EntityId=Ar03801&AppName=1). 

**The Data** comes from [DISE](http://www.dise.in/). It is very large as compared to the typical datasets used in most Econometrics studies. Its size is around 39 GB and it is spread over 150 files.

**Technologies:**  Stata, Latex.

### Entrepreneurship in the Transition Region

During a three month internship at the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development I co-authored Chapter 4 from the Transition Report 2011. Read Chapter 4 starting from page 76 [here](http://www.ebrd.com/downloads/research/transition/tr11.pdf).

**Abstract:**

_Entrepreneurial activity is a key contributor to economic growth, innovation and the 
development of a market economy in transition countries. LiTS data reveal that ﬁnancial sector development and access to credit are the most important drivers of entrepreneurship. Education is associated with a higher probability of trying  to set up a business, but not with more entrepreneurial success. Women are less likely to attempt to set up a venture but no less likely to succeed than men once they try. Furthermore, entrepreneurial activity develops in clusters. An individual is more likely to try – and succeed – in setting up a business in a region that is already home to many entrepreneurs._

### Entrepreneurship and Diversity

This project resulted is the paper available [here](http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=2272615). It is also the second chapter of my PhD thesis.

**Abstract:**

_Using the 2010 Life in Transition Survey, this paper studies the association between local religious diversity and individual entrepreneurial behavior in 29 transition countries. We find that localities with higher religious diversity have more respondents who have tried to set up a business. Although religious diversity also correlates with a higher start-up probability (following trial), this effect is driven by higher access to finance. We also provide suggestive evidence that the positive association between local religious diversity and entrepreneurial trial is positively moderated by social capital (when measured as access to weak ties and the ability to bridge structural holes)._
