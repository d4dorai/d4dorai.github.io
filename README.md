# Welcome!
This is a summary of projects and courses involving technology that I did over the last couple of years.

## Projects

###  Midday Meals in India

The final result of this project is a published paper. An older version of the paper is available online [here](http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=1969396). This version has been revised and extended and will be soon forthcoming in the Scandinavian Journal of Economics. It is also Chapter 1 of my PhD Thesis.


**Abstract:**

_At the end of 2001, the Indian Supreme Court issued a directive ordering states to institute school lunches -- known locally as ``midday meals" -- in government primary schools. This paper provides a large-scale assessment of the enrollment effects of India's midday meal scheme, which offers warm lunches, free of cost, to 120 million primary school children across India and is the largest school feeding program in the world. To isolate the causal effect of the policy, we make use of its staggered implementation across Indian states in government but not private schools. Using a panel data set of over 420,000 schools observed annually from 2002 to 2004, we find that midday meals result in substantial increases in primary school enrollment, driven by early primary school responses to the program. Our results are robust to a wide range of specification tests._


**In the News:** The findings of this paper are mentioned in [The Guardian](http://www.theguardian.com/global-development/poverty-matters/2013/jul/19/indian-school-lunch-deaths-midday-meals) as well as in [The Times of India](http://epaper.timesofindia.com/Default/Scripting/ArticleWin.asp?From=Archive&Source=Page&Skin=TOINEW&BaseHref=CAP%2F2010%2F07%2F26&ViewMode=HTML&PageLabel=38&EntityId=Ar03801&AppName=1). 

**The Data** comes from [DISE](http://www.dise.in/). It is very large as compared to the typical datasets used in most Econometrics studies. Its size is around 39 GB and it is spread over 150 files.

**Technologies:**  Stata, Latex.

### Entrepreneurship in the Transition Region

During a three month internship at the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development I co-authored Chapter 4 from the Transition Report 2011. Read Chapter 4 starting from page 76 [here](http://www.ebrd.com/downloads/research/transition/tr11.pdf).

**Abstract:**

_Entrepreneurial activity is a key contributor to economic growth, innovation and the 
development of a market economy in transition countries. LiTS data reveal that ﬁnancial sector development and access to credit are the most important drivers of entrepreneurship. Education is associated with a higher probability of trying  to set up a business, but not with more entrepreneurial success. Women are less likely to attempt to set up a venture but no less likely to succeed than men once they try. Furthermore, entrepreneurial activity develops in clusters. An individual is more likely to try – and succeed – in setting up a business in a region that is already home to many entrepreneurs._

**Technologies:** Stata, Excel, VBA for Excel Macros.

### Entrepreneurship and Diversity

This project resulted is the paper available [here](http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=2272615). It is also the second chapter of my PhD thesis.

**Abstract:**

_Using the 2010 Life in Transition Survey, this paper studies the association between local religious diversity and individual entrepreneurial behavior in 29 transition countries. We find that localities with higher religious diversity have more respondents who have tried to set up a business. Although religious diversity also correlates with a higher start-up probability (following trial), this effect is driven by higher access to finance. We also provide suggestive evidence that the positive association between local religious diversity and entrepreneurial trial is positively moderated by social capital (when measured as access to weak ties and the ability to bridge structural holes)._

### Hedging of Weather Risks

During an internship at the Matheon in Berlin I worked on predicting the probability that a hurricane will hit the US East Coast.

**Technologies**: R.

## Coursera Courses

Here is a selection of Coursera courses that I participated in:

### Introduction to Data Science

Commerce and research are being transformed by data-driven discovery and prediction. Skills required for data analytics at massive levels – scalable data management on and off the cloud, parallel algorithms, statistical modeling, and proficiency with a complex ecosystem of tools and platforms – span a variety of disciplines and are not easy to obtain through conventional curricula. Tour the basic techniques of data science, including both SQL and NoSQL solutions for massive data management (e.g., MapReduce and contemporaries), algorithms for data mining (e.g., clustering and association rule mining), and basic statistical modeling (e.g., linear and non-linear regression).

### Machine Learning

Machine learning is the science of getting computers to act without being explicitly programmed. In the past decade, machine learning has given us self-driving cars, practical speech recognition, effective web search, and a vastly improved understanding of the human genome. Machine learning is so pervasive today that you probably use it dozens of times a day without knowing it. Many researchers also think it is the best way to make progress towards human-level AI. In this class, you will learn about the most effective machine learning techniques, and gain practice implementing them and getting them to work for yourself. More importantly, you'll learn about not only the theoretical underpinnings of learning, but also gain the practical know-how needed to quickly and powerfully apply these techniques to new problems. Finally, you'll learn about some of Silicon Valley's best practices in innovation as it pertains to machine learning and AI.

This course provides a broad introduction to machine learning, datamining, and statistical pattern recognition. Topics include: (i) Supervised learning (parametric/non-parametric algorithms, support vector machines, kernels, neural networks). (ii) Unsupervised learning (clustering, dimensionality reduction, recommender systems, deep learning). (iii) Best practices in machine learning (bias/variance theory; innovation process in machine learning and AI). The course will also draw from numerous case studies and applications, so that you'll also learn how to apply learning algorithms to building smart robots (perception, control), text understanding (web search, anti-spam), computer vision, medical informatics, audio, database mining, and other areas.

### R Programming

In this course you will learn how to program in R and how to use R for effective data analysis. You will learn how to install and configure software necessary for a statistical programming environment and describe generic programming language concepts as they are implemented in a high-level statistical language. The course covers practical issues in statistical computing which includes programming in R, reading data into R, accessing R packages, writing R functions, debugging, profiling R code, and organizing and commenting R code. Topics in statistical data analysis will provide working examples.
